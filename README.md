# Taking attendence using face detection
Here in this project my main aim was to create an attendence sheet based on face recognition system, I have performed all the steps from data collection to the final outout which means marking attendence and the corresponding timeline in a csv file (attendence.csv) after the face detection of a person. 

I have mainly used three modules to make this project : Face recognition module (for face detection), datetime module (for taking the attendence) & opencv module (for marking the face which is detected)

I have tried to take the attendence of 4 persons in this project: Hrithik Roshan, Ratan tata, Chandi devi(my mom), Krish naik (A famous youtuber)

Rest of the things you can find in my code, I have used the best of my knowledge to explain everything there.
